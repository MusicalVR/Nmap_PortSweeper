This is my Nmap_PortSweeper script.

It should work on windows aslong as you have python and zenmap installed

Open it in visual code studio and make shure you have all the required pip modules installed

I made this in my Ethical Hacking class. 

This is to scan an entire network looking for your desired open port. Such as port 80 Http 

This helps you in the reconssince phase.

If you have any issues my discord is #the_musical_manokit
